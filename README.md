# StoryCheck #

StoryCheck is a simple-to-use mobile “editor in your pocket” aimed at reporters working in small, under resourced newsrooms, and less experienced freelance journalists who don’t have access to story briefings and debriefings and other essential input from an editor. It guides you through the reporting of a variety of different stories and helps ensure there are no gaps in your reporting.

 In a simple to use format, it lists the information needed to properly cover stories ranging from accidents to courts; crime to disasters; profiles to obituaries, and many more. 

 All you do is follow the steps and check off what you know on a story and it will tell you what you still need to find out. StoryCheck also offers simple guidelines for conducting interviews and questions to ask, tips on writing and how to count a crowd.
